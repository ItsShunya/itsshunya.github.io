Before anything else, let me do a quick intro of myself...

I’m **Victor**, although I also go by **Shunya** in the net! Based in Spain, I work as a Software Engineer in the medical device industry, mostly writing firmware for embedded devices but I also have quite some experience with desktop applications. My day-to-day is a mix of C/C++, ARM Cortex-M, Qt, Python, and whatever else is needed to get a medical device working reliably. It’s challenging, sometimes stressful, but always rewarding.

## Hello World!

After quite a few evenings tweaking Hugo, trying different layouts, breaking things, fixing them again, and fighting with configuration, the site is finally online. I’ve wanted a personal space for a while—somewhere to write things down, document what I learn, and have a place that’s actually mine instead of random notes scattered across folders.

This first post is simply me saying: *voilà*. Website done. Time to start using it.

## What I want to share here

I don’t have a strict plan, but the idea is to publish regularly. Some posts will be short, others will be more detailed. Probably a bit of everything. Topics will mostly come from what I work on or play with:

- Embedded development (C, ARM, debugging, low-power stuff)  
- Medical device software: firmware, Qt apps, documentation, testing 
- Practical notes about CI/CD, memory issues, drivers, and weird bugs  
- NixOS, home-lab ideas, and self-hosting  
- Random small things I learn and don’t want to forget  

Basically: whatever I’d tell a friend or coworker because *“hey, this might be useful.”*

## Why bother with a personal blog?

Because writing helps me organise my thoughts.  
Because future me will forget half the things I solved.  
And because, honestly, when I find a good blog post online that saves me hours of pain, I’m grateful someone took the time to write it. So this is my small contribution back.

Nothing huge today—just a start.  
If you’re reading this, thanks for passing by. More posts will come soon.
